    <h2>spaghetti bologness</h2>

    <p> I MAKE BOLOGNESE like I mean it. It becomes a situation where you’d think I’d be planning for an apocalypse and we’re going to starve I MAKE SO MUCH. </p>
    <p> The ONLY way we love our bolognese is cooked in a slow cooker or crockpot. With meat so incredibly soft and tender, it falls apart all over your pasta. This family recipe makes enough to freeze any left overs for any emergency dinner situations, OR
        enough for the next day. Just boil up some more pasta and you have a restaurant quality meal two days in a row! NO COOKING! Well, except for boiling the pasta, which is simple itself. OR, do what we do and use the leftovers to smother ALL over
        toast. </p>
    <h3> lngredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1large onion finely chopped</li>
        <li>1pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
        <li> 28 ounces crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 good sized handful fresh parsley chopped</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>½ pound spaghetti</li>
        <li>Grated Pecorino Romano or Parmesan cheese for serving optional</li>


    </ul>
    <h3> Method or steps</h3>
    <ol>

        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the onions and sauté until lightly golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the garlic and fry another minute.</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef; fry until fully cooked and no pink shows at all in the meat (about 8 minutes). Add the oregano and tomato paste and mix with the meat.</li>
        <li>Add the tomatoes, parsley, and bring to a boil. Season with the salt and pepper. Reduce the heat to low, and cook for at least 15 minutes (you can cook longer for a deeper flavor).</li>
        <li>In the meantime, cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions. Drain and serve topped with the sauce and cheese (if using).</li>

    <p> This is also a very versatile dish. I’ve had readers report back that they’ve used anything from salmon to pistachios as variations. Don’t be afraid to add your own personal touch to this easily adaptable recipe. This spaghetti with spinach sauce
        is not only delicious, but it’s really healthy too. </p>
    <p> Spinach has so many health benefits. It’s high in iron, as well as vitamins A and C. Spinach is loaded with not only nutrients, but it’s also rich in antioxidants. </p>
    <h3> lngredients</h3>

    <h3> Steps or Method</h3>

    <ol>
